# Image-classification-in-cloud
## Openclassroom project nÂ°8

The goal of this project is to prepare a cloud architechture that would be able to featurise a big quatity of image data.
We used a cluster using Pyspark in AWS EMR using EC2 machines to build a master node and 3 slaves nodes to start with.

The notebook is the one we run in the cluster.
The presentation is what was shown to the jury.
